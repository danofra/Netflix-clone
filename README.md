# Netflix Clone with API

This project is a Netflix clone integrated with APIs, developed as part of my study journey. The aim was to practice front-end technologies such as Bootstrap, JavaScript, and React, while also integrating API data to mimic the functionality of the Netflix platform.

## Description

The Netflix Clone with API project is an enhanced version of the static Netflix clone. In addition to replicating the visual design and layout of the original Netflix site, this project fetches real data from APIs to display dynamic content such as movie titles, descriptions, and images. By integrating APIs, it offers a more realistic user experience similar to the actual Netflix platform.
